Machine learning has progressed quickly in recent years, and the tools and techniques continue to evolve. To be effective with machine learning, you'll need to use a programming language. Python is the most popular programming language and a great place to start. Others will use R and those looking to squeeze the last bit of performance will use a lower-level language like C or Rust. However, if you're smart about how you use Python, you can get great performance without resorting to these lower-level languages. Scikit-Learn is a popular library for working with tabular data. It has many algorithms for creating both supervised and unsupervised models. It also provides pipelines for creating workflows. Another advantage of Scikit-Learn is that it has a consistent API. Once you know how to create a regression model using linear regression, it's trivial to try a different model such as the decision tree, and more advanced libraries like XGBoost and CatBoost have followed the lead of Scikit-Learn and use the same API. A consistent API makes it really easy to try these more powerful models and compare the results. Creating models isn't hard, it's like three lines of code. However, prepping the data so that you can create a model or evaluating your model after you make it is more nuanced and can take a lot more time. For data preparation, I like to use libraries like pandas or Polars. These libraries enable quick and efficient manipulation of tabular data. For model evaluation, we need to understand the basic metrics of a model and the business needs. We can also use visualization to get a feel for how the model performs. I like to use plotting libraries like Matplotlib and plotly for this. Creating a model on its own is worthless if we can't use it. We'll show how to use the MLflow library to deploy our model. If you understand these tools, you can create impressive models. If you can master these tools, you can make a big impact. Because we're using Codespaces in this course, you can easily follow along with the code. There's no complicated installation step. You can run the same code I'm showing, then you can practice with these exercises and get more exposure. This course will focus on a regression problem with tabular data. We'll see how to use the polar's library to process the data, then we'll use both Scikit-Learn and CatBoost for modeling. In addition to the tooling that Scikit-Learn provides, we'll use visualization to understand the models. Finally, we'll use the MLflow tool to deploy our models. Are you ready to dive into these tools of machine learning? Let's go.


The “Tools for ML” video outlines essential tools and libraries for machine learning, emphasizing their importance in the field. Here are the key takeaways:

Python as the Primary Language: Python is highlighted as the most popular language for machine learning, with a mention of other languages like R, C, and Rust for specific performance needs.
Libraries and Frameworks: It introduces Scikit-Learn for working with tabular data, mentioning its consistent API that simplifies model experimentation. Other libraries like pandas and Polars for data manipulation, and plotting libraries like Matplotlib and plotly for visualization, are also discussed.
Model Deployment: The video covers MLflow for deploying models, showcasing the end-to-end application of machine learning from data preparation to deployment.

These insights could be particularly valuable for you as you aim to deepen your understanding of machine learning tools and transition into a machine learning engineer role.
